# Social Media Platform Popularity Analysis
By: Natalia Garcia-Arias

June 2021

### What this does
There are three panels in the application. The first panel on the left includes a list of social media platforms with check-boxes on the side, which the user can interact with. The purpose of this feature is to allow the user to choose which platform data they would like to include in the visualization. 

The visualization is a line graph that can be updated by the user interacting with the first panel as previously described. 

The final panel can be found on the right. This is an interactive table, including all the data that this application is based off of. The user can interact with this in various different ways:

**Using the sort buttons**
* Sort the data by year (least to most recent)
* Sort the data by platform (A to Z)
* Sort the data by monthly active users (least to most) 

**Using the search bar**:
The user can search the dataset for all data of the inputted platform name

**Additional Feature**:
By double-clicking on a row in the table, a window displaying the social media platform logo as well as some additional information will appear.


### Dataset Description

This dataset demonstrates the growth of social media platforms over time. This set includes information for a variety of popular platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, etc. Altogether, the CSV data includes the platform name, year of the datapoint, and monthly active users of the platform that year. As an additional component, I assigned a logo to the corresponding statistic (e.g. "Facebook" logo to all "Facebook" statistics).

**Why I selected this data**

I chose to explore this topic because I found it would be interesting to analyze the rise of social media over the past few decades. There is no denying that there has been a rapid increase of social media activity, more so during the pandemic. In addition, I found that getting a dataset that included information from earlier years gave me the opportunity to take my analysis further. This is because I was able to also explore platforms that used to be highly popular, and how their popularity changed with the rise of our current favourite social media platforms.

After having visualized my data, I was able to notice some trends. For example, YouTube and Facebook seem to have the steepest rate of change, as noted in my linechart. As this happened, I noticed that the growth older platforms started to plateau, and even decrease. I found this to be an accurate representation of how social media has changed over the years. As newer platforms gain popularity, older platforms lose popularity. It was quite eye-opening to look at the number of monthly active users, as many of the numbers were in the millions. It surely gave me a better perspective on society's consumption of social media content.
